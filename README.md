# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides seamless access to the Modellix platform, a comprehensive Model as a Service (MaaS) offering over 100 generative AI models. Agents can leverage this skill to perform a wide array of AI-powered tasks, including image and video generation, image editing, and specialized creative applications.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a unified AI model API platform that aggregates generative AI models from providers like Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax, supporting:

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create high-quality images from text prompts using models like Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, and Seedream series.
- **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Edit and transform existing images using text prompts, with capabilities for style transfer, object manipulation, and more.
- **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate cinematic quality videos from text descriptions with models like Seedance 1.5 Pro and Wan 2.6 T2V.
- **Image-to-Video Generation**: Convert static images into dynamic video sequences with models like Wan 2.6 I2V and Seedance.
- **Image Editing Operations**: Perform specialized tasks such as text editing in images (bilingual support), color adjustment, style transfer, object addition/removal, image outpainting, and background generation.
- **Virtual Try-On and Fashion**: Generate AI virtual try-on effects for clothing applications.
- **Image Translation**: Translate text within images across multiple languages.
- **Specialized Image Generation**: Create WordArt, convert sketches to images, and generate backgrounds.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: All API calls are asynchronous, returning a `task_id` for later retrieval of results.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear cost structures based on image or video duration.
- **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Backed by extensive IT service expertise and robust infrastructure.
