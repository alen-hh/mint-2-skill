## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a comprehensive Model as a Service (MaaS) platform that offers API access to a wide range of generative AI models from leading providers such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax. It empowers agents and developers with capabilities including:

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create images from text prompts using models like Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, and Seedream series.
- **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Edit and transform existing images with text prompts, including style transfer, object manipulation, and detail enhancement.
- **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate high-quality videos from text descriptions using models like Seedance 1.5 Pro and Wan 2.6 T2V.
- **Image-to-Video Generation**: Convert static images into dynamic video sequences with various artistic styles and motion.
- **Specialized Image Editing**: Perform advanced tasks such as bilingual text editing in images, color adjustment, image outpainting, background generation, and sketch-to-image conversion.
- **Virtual Try-On**: Generate AI virtual try-on effects for fashion applications.
- **Image Translation**: Translate text within images across multiple languages.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: All model API calls are asynchronous, returning a `task_id` for status checking and result retrieval.
- **Transparent Pricing & Logging**: Clear pricing structures and detailed logging for all operations.
- **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Backed by extensive IT service expertise and robust infrastructure.
