# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides seamless integration with the Modellix platform, enabling AI agents to leverage a comprehensive suite of over 100 generative AI models for a wide range of creative and analytical tasks.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a unified Model as a Service (MaaS) platform that offers API access to a vast collection of cutting-edge AI models. It empowers agents to perform tasks such as generating high-quality images from text, creating videos from text or images, editing existing images with precision, translating text within images, and executing virtual try-on functionalities. The platform is built for enterprise-grade reliability, featuring asynchronous task processing, transparent pricing, detailed logging, and robust support backed by extensive IT service expertise.

Key capabilities include:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation**: Utilizing models like Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, and Seedream series to create diverse images from text prompts.
*   **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Editing and transforming images with text prompts, including style transfer, object manipulation, and color adjustments.
*   **Text-to-Video Generation**: Producing cinematic-quality videos from text descriptions with advanced features like multi-shot narratives and custom audio integration.
*   **Image-to-Video Generation**: Converting static images into dynamic video sequences with motion and animation.
*   **Specialized Image Editing**: Performing tasks such as bilingual text editing in images, outpainting, background generation, and sketch-to-image conversion.
*   **Virtual Try-On and Fashion**: Generating realistic virtual try-on effects for clothing applications.
*   **Image Translation**: Translating text within images across multiple languages.

Modellix supports asynchronous task processing, ensuring efficient handling of long-running generation tasks. Pricing is transparent and based on usage units (per image or per second of video).
