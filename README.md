# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides a seamless interface for AI agents to leverage the extensive capabilities of the Modellix platform, granting access to over 100 generative AI models for a wide array of creative and editing tasks.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a comprehensive, unified API platform that aggregates a vast collection of generative AI models from leading providers such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax. It empowers agents with the ability to perform a diverse range of tasks, including:

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create images from textual descriptions using models like Qwen Image Plus, Wanx, Seedream, and Hailuo, supporting various artistic styles.
- **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate videos from text prompts with cinematic quality using models like Wan 2.6 T2V, Seedance, and Hailuo 02 T2V, with options for automatic dubbing.
- **Image-to-Video Generation**: Produce videos from image references and text prompts with models like Wan 2.6 I2V, Seedance I2V, and Hailuo 02 I2V.
- **Image Editing**: Modify existing images through text instructions, including style transfer, watermark removal, image expansion, detail enhancement, and object manipulation.
- **Specialized Image Tasks**: Perform advanced operations such as virtual try-on, image outpainting for extending image boundaries, image translation to localize text within images, and creating artistic WordArt.
- **Asynchronous Task Processing**: All tasks are processed asynchronously, allowing agents to submit requests and retrieve results later via a task ID, with full logging for monitoring and auditing.
- **API Authentication and Management**: Secure access through API keys, with robust management features available via the Modellix console.
- **Rate Limiting and Quotas**: Understand and manage API usage with clear rate limits and quota information provided in response headers.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear cost structures for different models and task types, charged per image or per second of video.
