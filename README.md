# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides seamless integration with the Modellix platform, a unified Model as a Service (MaaS) offering access to over 100 AI models for a wide range of generative AI tasks. Agents can leverage this skill to generate images from text, create videos from text or images, edit existing images, perform virtual try-ons, and much more, all through a single, powerful API.

## What is Modellix?

[Modellix](https://modellix.ai) is a comprehensive AI model API platform that aggregates cutting-edge generative AI models from leading providers such as Alibaba, ByteDance, and MiniMax. It empowers agents with a diverse set of capabilities, including:

- **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create high-quality images from text prompts using models like Qwen Image, Wan 2.6 T2I, and Seedream series.
- **Image-to-Image Transformation**: Edit and transform existing images with text prompts, supporting capabilities like style transfer, object addition/removal, and color adjustment.
- **Text-to-Video Generation**: Generate cinematic-quality videos from text descriptions using models like Seedance 1.5 Pro and Wan 2.6 T2V.
- **Image-to-Video Generation**: Convert static images into dynamic video sequences with motion and animation.
- **Specialized Image Editing**: Perform advanced tasks such as text editing in images (bilingual support), image outpainting, background generation, and sketch-to-image conversion.
- **Virtual Try-On and Fashion**: Generate AI virtual try-on effects for clothing and fashion applications.
- **Image Translation**: Translate text within images across multiple languages.

The platform is designed for enterprise-grade reliability, offering asynchronous task processing, transparent pricing, detailed logging, and robust support.
