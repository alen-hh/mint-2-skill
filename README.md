# Modellix Agent Skill

This Agent Skill provides a seamless integration with the Modellix platform, enabling AI agents to leverage a vast array of over 100 generative AI models through a unified API. Agents can perform complex tasks such as generating images and videos from text, transforming existing images, performing virtual try-ons, and much more, all powered by cutting-edge AI models from leading providers.

## What is Modellix?

Modellix is a comprehensive Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform offering API access to a diverse collection of generative AI models. It simplifies the integration of advanced AI capabilities for various applications, including:

*   **Generative AI Models**: Access to 100+ AI models for tasks like image generation, video creation, and image editing.
*   **Key Capabilities**: Includes Text-to-Image, Image-to-Image transformation, Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video generation, specialized Image Editing operations (like text editing in images, color adjustment, style transfer, object addition/removal, outpainting, background generation, and sketch-to-image conversion), Virtual Try-On, and Image Translation.
*   **Supported Providers**: Integrates models from Alibaba (Qwen, Wan, Wanx), ByteDance (Seedance, Seedream, Seededit), and MiniMax (Hailuo, MiniMax).
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: All API calls are asynchronous, returning a `task_id` for status tracking and result retrieval, enabling efficient handling of long-running tasks.
*   **Transparent Pricing**: Clear pricing structures based on usage units (per image, per second of video).
*   **Enterprise-Grade Features**: Offers detailed logging, transaction clarity, high availability infrastructure, and SLA operational standards.
*   **Developer Tools**: Supports MCP integration for documentation search and provides SDKs and examples for various AI development environments.
